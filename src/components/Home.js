        <h2>About me</h2>
        <hr />

        <p>
          I'm a recent HyperionDev Software Engineer Graduate and a self-driven
          innovative individual who always seeks new challenges to take on. I'm
          a very honest and open person that love helping others in anything
          that they find difficult. I have self-taught development background
          through various online trainings and platforms, these include
          Microsoft Azure and AWS. I like to set deadlines and meet them and
          this gives me a sense of accomplishment and I love creating an
          organised schedule for completing tasks on time. I would definetily
          want to develop innovative solutions that solves many problems that my
          country is facing and the world at large.
        </p>

          Being a developer was always my passion growing up. While i was
          browsing through the internet looking for opportunities i came across
          a <b>SovTech</b> post about launching the second Graduate Programme. I
          researched a bit about the company and i found out that it's an
          amazing place to be at. As a leading innovative tech institute there
          is no way that it could have gotten this far without providing a
          platform for people to grow in. I want to be part of a team that
          always excels and that care about its people and hope to join the
          platform as well.
        </p>
